# GNOME Shell extension to display CGM readings from Nightscout

This is just a very simple extension I made to fetch glucose readings from my Nightscout site and display them in the panel. For now it's mostly for my personal use and has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Installation

At the moment there are no configuration options, so the Nightscout API URL has to be manually changed in extension.js. Then, you can run the commands in install.sh to copy the files to the appropriate directory. Run gnome-tweaks and enable the extension. Last, hit Alt+F2, type "r", and press enter to restart the GNOME Shell.
